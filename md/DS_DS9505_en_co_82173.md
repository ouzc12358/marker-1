# High-Quality Pressure Sensor With Mounted Diaphragm Seal With Milk Thread Fitting Model Dss18T

## Applications

 
- Hygienic pressure measurement in sanitary applications 
for the food and beverage industry
 
- For dairies, dairy products, breweries and soft drink 
production
 
- Mounting to pipelines and vessels with 4 ... 20 mA output 
signal
 
- For gases, compressed air, vapour; liquid, pasty, powdery 
and crystallising media

## Special Features

 
- Quick cleaning, without residue
 
- Milk thread fitting per DIN 11851
 
- Suitable for cleaning out of place (COP)

## Description

Diaphragm seal systems are used to protect the pressure measuring instrument from aggressive, adhesive, crystallising, corrosive, highly viscous, environmentally hazardous or toxic media. The diaphragm made of stainless steel provides for the separation from the medium. The pressure is transmitted to the measuring instrument via the system fill fluid which is inside the diaphragm seal system. The DSS18T complies with all requirements of the food industry. The milk thread fitting enables a hygienic process connection. The requirements of COP (cleaning out of place) are fulfilled.

## Pressure

The diaphragm seal systems can withstand the cleaning vapour temperatures occurring in the SIP processes and thus ensure a sterile connection between the medium to be measured and the diaphragm seal. The proven, all-welded construction ensures a long service life and permanent sealing. The DSS18T is used for pressure measurement in various process steps, e.g. filtration, separation, pasteurisation, and in filling systems.
