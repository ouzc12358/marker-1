# High-Quality Pressure Sensor With Mounted Diaphragm Seal With Flange Connection, Internal Diaphragm Model Dss26T

## Applications

 
- For aggressive, highly viscous, crystallising or hot media
 
- Machine building and plant construction
 
- Process industry
 
- For small flange process connections

## Special Features

 
- Open flange with internal, all welded diaphragm
 
- No sealings and clamping elements
 
- Robust, all welded design
 
- Compact design

## Description

Diaphragm seal systems are used to protect the pressure measuring instrument from aggressive, adhesive, crystallising, corrosive, highly viscous, environmentally hazardous or toxic media. The diaphragm made of stainless steel provides for the separation from the medium. The pressure is transmitted to the measuring instrument via the system fill fluid which is inside the diaphragm seal system. Due to its design - with open flange connection and internal diaphragm - the DSS26T is suitable for all currently used standard flanges and is mounted to small process connections for pressure measurement.

The DSS26T is ideally suited for demanding measuring tasks and achieves a very high accuracy. It offers the advantage of being able to transmit the measuring signal directly and to combine it with a variety of electrical connections. Mounting of the diaphragm seal to the measuring instrument is made via direct mounting as standard. The DSS26T is particularly well suited for aggressive, highly viscous, crystallising or hot media. The measuring system is successfully used worldwide in chemical and petrochemical industries with high measuring requirements.
