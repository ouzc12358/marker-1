# High-Quality Pressure Sensor With Mounted Diaphragm Seal With Flange Connection, Flush Diaphragm Model Dss27T

## Applications

 
- For aggressive, highly viscous, crystallising or hot media
 
- Process industry
 
- Machine building and plant construction

## Special Features

 
- Flange with a flush welded diaphragm
 
- Robust, all welded design
 
- Universal application

## Description

Diaphragm seal systems are used to protect the pressure measuring instrument from aggressive, adhesive, crystallising, corrosive, highly viscous, environmentally hazardous or toxic media. The diaphragm made of stainless steel provides for the separation from the medium. The pressure is transmitted to the measuring instrument via the system fill fluid which is inside the diaphragm seal system. The DSS27T with flange connection and flush diaphragm is available following currently used, international flange standards.

The DSS27T is ideally suited for demanding measuring tasks and achieves a very high accuracy. It offers the advantage of being able to transmit the measuring signal directly and to combine it with a variety of electrical connections. Mounting of the diaphragm seal to the measuring instrument is made via direct mounting as standard. The DSS27T is particularly well suited for aggressive, highly viscous, crystallising or hot media. The measuring system is successfully used worldwide in the chemical process and petrochemical industries with high measuring requirements.
