# High-Quality Pressure Sensor With Mounted Diaphragm Seal With Clamp Connection Model Dss22T

## Applications

 
- Hygienic pressure measurement in sanitary applications 
for the food and beverage industry
 
- Mounting to pipelines and vessels with 4 ... 20 mA output 
signal
 
- Pressure/vacuum monitoring during cleaning, sterilisation, 
pressure testing
 
- For gases, compressed air, vapour; liquid, pasty, powdery 
and crystallising media

## Special Features

 
- Quick cleaning, without residue
 
- Clamp connection easy to open for cleaning and seal 
replacement
 
- Suitable for SIP and CIP

## Description

Diaphragm seal systems are used to protect the pressure measuring instrument from aggressive, adhesive, crystallising, corrosive, highly viscous, environmentally hazardous or toxic media. The diaphragm made of stainless steel provides for the separation from the medium. The pressure is transmitted to the measuring instrument via the system fill fluid which is inside the diaphragm seal system. The DSS22T complies with all requirements of the food industry. The particular suitability for foodstuffs rests on the fact that the measuring point can be cleaned while installed.

## Diaphragm Seal System, Model Dss22T

The requirements of CIP (cleaning in place) and SIP (sterilisation in place) are fulfilled. The clamp connection enables the quick and easy dismounting and thus a simple cleaning with seal replacement. The proven, all-welded construction ensures a long service life and permanent sealing. The DSS22T is particularly well suited for gases, compressed air and vapour as well as liquid, pasty, powdery and crystallising media.
