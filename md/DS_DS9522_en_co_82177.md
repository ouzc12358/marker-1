# High-Quality Pressure Sensor With Mounted Diaphragm Seal With Process Connection Per Svensk Standard Ss 1145 Model Dss19T, For Food

## Applications

 
- Hygienic pressure measurement in sanitary applications 
for the food and beverage industry
 
- Mounting to pipelines and vessels with 4 ... 20 mA output 
signal
 
- For gases, compressed air, vapour; liquid, pasty, powdery 
and crystallising media

## Special Features

 
- Quick cleaning, without residue
 
- Process connection per Svensk Standard SS 1145
 
- Suitable for cleaning out of place (COP)
 
- Sterilisation-in-Place (SIP) up to max. 130 °C [266 °F]

## Description

The DSS19T complies with the requirements of the food industry. The threaded connection enables a hygienic process connection. The requirements of COP (cleaning out of place) are fulfilled. The diaphragm seal systems can withstand the cleaning vapour temperatures occurring in the SIP processes and thus ensure a sterile connection between the medium to be measured and the diaphragm seal.
