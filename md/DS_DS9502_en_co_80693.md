# High-Quality Pressure Sensor With Mounted Diaphragm Seal With Threaded Connection, Threaded Design Model Dss10T

## Applications

 
- For aggressive, hot, corrosive, environmentally hazardous 
or toxic media
 
- Chemical and petrochemical industries
 
- Harsh environments in the process industry

## Special Features

 
- Process connection with thread for direct threaded 
connection
 
- Version with internal diaphragm
 
- Diaphragm seal parts screwed together
 
- Universal application

## Description

Diaphragm seal systems are used to protect the pressure measuring instrument from aggressive, adhesive, crystallising, corrosive, highly viscous, environmentally hazardous or toxic media. The diaphragm made of stainless steel provides for the separation from the medium. The pressure is transmitted to the measuring instrument via the system fill fluid which is inside the diaphragm seal system. Due to its design, the DSS10T can be used universally. A replacement of the lower body is possible (e.g. when changing the process connection) without having to carry out modifications on the diaphragm seal system.

## Pressure

WIKA data sheet DS 95.02
The DSS10T is ideally suited for demanding measuring tasks and achieves a very high accuracy. It is characterised by its robust design and can be used for a multitude of applications. Mounting of the diaphragm seal to the measuring instrument is made via direct mounting as standard. The DSS10T is particularly well suited for aggressive or hot media. This instrument is mainly geared to applications in the process industry.
