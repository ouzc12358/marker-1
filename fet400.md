## Why Is Aquamaster4 Your First Choice For Distribution Networks And Revenue Metering Applications?

| Your challenge                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AquaMaster4 offers highest accuracy with a wide flow range. Our 0D       |
| upstream and downstream reduced bore sensor is virtually insensitive     |
| to hydraulic disturbances as it conditions the upstream fluid flow       |
| profile within the sensor's central measuring zone giving superior       |
| performance; especially during the night when the flow rate is low.      |
| Do you have                                                              |

| The AquaMaster4's in-built Data Logger runs at high speed, logging       |
| at a fast rate giving the user total flexibility to download (typically  |
| 15 minutes) logged data; then investigate, in precise detail, flow and   |
| pressure activity during a period of interest at even higher time        |
| resolution.                                                              |
| Such high resolution data facilitates step testing, leakage detection    |
| and water network analysis. The in-built logger delivers accuracies      |
| which are not possible when using an external data logger.               |
| A free app (Velox Interface) is available for use with Android and       |
| Windows™ smartphones and tablets. This supports simple                   |
| configuration changes to made on your touchscreen color phone /          |
| tablet. Just touch to upload, then configure offline, touch again to     |
| update the AquaMaster4 configuration.                                    |
| Do you want to reduce                                                    |
| the cost for                                                             |
| commissioning and                                                        |

| product?                                                                 |
| The logger contents can be downloaded as a file in industry-standard     |
| CSV format in the same manner. To ensure the product remains up-to-      |
| date with the latest features and enhancements, the firmware is          |
| updated using the Velox Interface app.                                   |
| 'Fit-and-Flow' data storage inside AquaMaster4 eliminates the need to    |
| match a remote sensor with a transmitter in the field. On initial        |
| installation, the self-configuration sequence replicates all calibration |
| factors, meter size and serial numbers, together with customer site-     |
| specific settings, into the transmitter automatically, eliminating the   |
| opportunity for error.                                                   |
| Using two standard off-the-shelf 'D' lithium cells, the AquaMaster4 can  |
| be operated for up to 10 years.                                          |

Using a simple DC (6 to 32 V) connection from sources as small as a 5 W solar panel / wind generator, AquaMaster4 can be operated with green energy sources.

Do you want to have the lowest operational expenditure throughout the lifecycle of the product?

There is no longer any need for bespoke cables and laptops to connect to each transmitter. In-situ self checking of flowmeter health enables the user to meet regulatory / technical requirements. In 1995 ABB invented and designed the world's first in-situ verification system for electromagnetic flowmeters. Building on ABB's fingerprint philosophy, each flow meter is verification tested before shipping from the factory. SRV500 enables the operator to choose whether to either use the factory fingerprint or, after product commissioning, to create a new fingerprint based on real site conditions.

## Calibration In Abb Flow Laboratory

ABB's flow calibration facilities are certified by various national independent accredited bodies / laboratories and these are all are linked by the 'International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation' (ILAC7).

Flowmeters in ABB's facilities can be calibrated by one of the following methods: - gravimetric (using weigh scales) - volumetric (using the meter prover) - comparison (using reference meters)
Additionally, ABB's laboratories are checked against each other and against external accredited laboratories using transfer standard meters.

Gravimetric In this method, the flowmeter is calibrated in a pipeline, with water being pumped through it from a sump. A diverter valve situated downstream directs the flow from the meter either back to the sump or to a tank of sufficient capacity attached to a highly accurate weighing system. Volumetric There are two main methods of volumetric calibration:

- Fixed volume volumetric tank method
 - This method works in a similar way to the gravimetric 
method, except that the flow from the meter is diverted into a tank of known volumetric capacity. This eliminates the need for a weighing system or to calculate the volume of water from its weight.

## - Fixed Volume Ball Meter Prover

 - In this method, the diverter valve directs the flow from 
the meter into a meter prover. The prover is a precisely manufactured section of pipe containing a sphere that is three percent larger in diameter than the pipe. Two detector switches are situated in the pipe at a fixed distance apart. The volume of water that is contained in the pipe between the switches is known as the calibrated volume.
Comparison In this method, the flowmeter under calibration is installed in a pipeline in series with a reference, or master, flowmeter with a known calibration. Once the flow of water through both meters is stable, a timer is started and the outputs of both meters are simultaneously monitored. After a set period, the timer is stopped. Using the data from the calibration run enables the average flowrate of the meter under test to be compared with the master meter, with the difference being the error. Advantages of ABB's calibration rig ABB has one of the largest calibration facilities in the world, capable of pumping 2.5 m3/s, enabling larger meters to be calibrated at high flowrates. All of ABB calibration facilities are continuously pumped enabling a flowmeter to calibrated at a steady flowrate (for example, over 300 or 600 seconds; or longer if required), to reduce a meter's random uncertainty errors during calibration. ABB's high turndown flowmeters (those with a high R number) can be calibrated over an extended flow range, guaranteeing accurate flowmeter performance over its full operating range.

## Verification

What is verification?

Verification is the inspection and testing of a product to establish that it meets regulatory / technical requirements Industrial instrumentation is robust, very reliable and designed to operate for many years with minimal maintenance. In today's competitive environment customers are looking for ways to maximize their profitability, regular product verifications is one way to ensure processes continuously operate at their peak. The ABB verification story Customers in the water and process industries have been able to save large sums of money thanks to ABB's innovations in product verification over the last two decades.

Introducing SRV500 
The next generation verification tool suite for use with ABB's complete range of active electronic flow meters. Download the software for free and use the instrument-specific test routine to provide the best possible check of product health, without stopping your process. SRV500 verifies the condition and performance of the flow meter under test. With the licensed software version, test reports can be generated and stored locally for further analysis. SRV500 also analyzes the product internal diagnostics and compares the results with historical measurements.

SRV500 enables the operator to choose whether to use either the factory fingerprint or to create a new fingerprint based on real site conditions after product commissioning. All verifications performed in the field can then be compared with the fingerprint data and previous tests to ensure flow meter performance has not degraded.

## - Dimensions - Insertion Flowmeter Installation Requirements - Sensor

This section is intended to give an overview of installation of a flowmeter. For Installation requirements, technical information and Health and Safety precautions refer to User Guide OI/FER100/FER200-EN. Unpacking the flowmeter Care must be taken when lifting the flowmeter to use the lifting hooks provided or sling under the body of the meter. Never lift the flowmeter using the terminal connection box of the sensor cable as this causes damage and invalidates the warranty. Grounding The flowmeter sensor must be cross-bonded to the upstream and downstream pipes. For technical reasons, this potential must be identical to the potential of the metering fluid. The fluid connection is made by installing 2 fluid contact rings (for grounding).

Note. The grounding arrangements shown below are applicable to both cathodic and non-cathodic protected installations. Mounting The installation conditions shown below must be observed to achieve the best operational results. The sensor tube must always be completely full. The flow direction must correspond to the identification plate. The flowmeter measures the flowrate in both directions. Forward flow is the factory setting. The flowmeter must be installed without mechanical tension (torsion, bending). If necessary, support the pipeline.

## - …Installation Requirements - Sensor

The flange seal material must be compatible with the fluid and fluid temperatures. Seals must not extend into the flow area as this causes turbulence that adversely influences flowmeter accuracy. The pipeline must not exert any forces and torques on the flowmeter (for example, vibration). The flowmeter must not be submitted to localized heating during installation; take care to remember this is a measuring instrument.

The flowmeter must not be exposed to direct sunlight. 

Provide appropriate sun protection where necessary. The cable to the flowmeter must be installed neatly or within a conduit. Both loose or conduit installations must have a u-bend below terminal connection box height to enable any water to run off thus avoiding any capillary action into the flowmeter sensor. Electrode axis The electrode axis must be horizontal wherever possible or no more than 45° from horizontal.
