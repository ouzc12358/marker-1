## Unik 5000 Pressure Sensing Platform

The new UNIK 5000 is a high performance configurable solution to pressure measurement. The use of micromachined silicon technology and analogue circuitry enables best in class performance for stability, low power and frequency response. The new platform enables you to easily build up your own sensor to match your own precise needs. This high performance, configurable solution to pressure measurement employs modular design and lean manufacturing techniques.

High Quality The combination of a high technology sensor, together with advanced signal conditioning and packaging techniques,  provides an ideal long term solution for reliable, accurate and economical measurements.

Bespoke as Standard Custom-built from standard components, manufacturing sensors to your requirement is fast and simple; each UNIK 5000 is a "bespoke" pressure sensing solution, but with the short lead times and competitive pricing you would expect from standard products.

Expertise We have the people and the knowledge to support your needs for accurate and reliable product performance; our team of experts can help you make the right sensor selection, guiding you and providing the help and tools you need. It is important to ensure that the sensor material and performance selected are suitable for your application.

Shunt Calibration Shunt Calibration provides a customer accessible connection which, when applied, causes a shift in output of 80% FS in order to simulate applied pressure. It is fitted to the mV, Configurable 4-wire and Configurable 3-wire versions as standard. It is not available with DIN, M12 x 1 or M20 x 1.5 electrical connectors (options 7, D, G and R). Shunt calibration is activated in different ways depending on the electrical connector and version: - 
mV versions: connect Shunt Cal to -ve Supply or where available, connect both Shunt Cal connections together.

- 
Configurable 4-wire and Configurable 3-wire versions: connect Shunt Cal to -ve Output or, where available, connect both Shunt Cal connections together.
Note: Not available with reverse output.

Performance Specifications There are three grades of performance specification: Industrial, Improved and Premium.

## Accuracy

Voltage, Current and mV Linearised
Combined effects of non-linearity, hysteresis and repeatability: - 
Industrial: ±0.2% FS BSL
